# Things the full app would have

Client side

- Title logo
- Icon next to the score counter
- If the completed tasks are not set to be hidden, they are set aside in a list of their own down
  below
- Date picker for the tasks
- The option to sort the tasks by date or by personal order by dragging the tiles 
- Being able to sort by personal order within dates when sorting by date is selected
- The option to add multiple tasks pages
- Events
- A calendar
- Themes
- Improving some of the graphics and transitions
- Store the data in your account, which would be synced with the webapp

Code design

- Maybe use a Map to store the tasks data instead of a List
- Make each page an instance of a class called "Page" that contains at least the AppBar
- Abstract the buttons from the add_item_button for clean code
- See if abstract item_button de add_item_button
