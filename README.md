# Things the full app would have

Client side

- Title logo
- Icon next to the score counter
- If the completed tasks are not set to be hidden, they are set aside in a list of their own down
  below
- Tasks with dates set to today or tomorrow would show "today" or "tomorrow" respectively instead
  of the date
- The option to add multiple tasks pages
- Events
- A calendar
- Themes
- Improving some of the graphics and transitions
- Store the data in your account, which would be synced with the webapp

Code design

- Maybe use a Map to store the tasks data instead of a List
- Make each page an instance of a class called "Page" that contains at least the AppBar
- Check which class fields (if any) are set as "required" but shouldn't be
