# Things the full app would have

Client side

- Title logo
- Stylized points counter
- Improving some of the graphics and transitions
- If the completed tasks are not set to be removed, they are set aside in a list of their own down
  below
- The option to add multiple tasks pages
- A calendar
- Themes
- Store the data in your account, which would be synced with the webapp
- Maybe make it so you can choose to hide the completed tasks instead of deleting them

Code design

- Maybe use a Map to store the tasks data instead of a List
- Making each page an instance of a class called "Page" that contains at least the AppBar
- Make the scoreModifier not required
